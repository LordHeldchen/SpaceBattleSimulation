++ Stats

Once all Layouts and Modifications are decided, a [Blueprint] may be created that summarizes the stats of the so-designed ship.
Those stats are:

* [Weapons]: [Accuracy], [Damage], [Penetration Power]
* [Armor]: Amount, [Defensive Strength]
* [Shields]: Amount, [Defensive Strength], [Regeneration], [Armor Hardening]
* [Propulsion]: [Battle Speed], [Battle Speed Decay], [Evasion], [Starlane Speed]  << Probably some sort or other of "Delta V"?
* [Electronics]: Sensor Strength, [Electronic Shielding]
* [Tactics]: [Preferred Targets], [Rapid Fire]
* [Cargo]: [Payload], [Supply], [Wings]
