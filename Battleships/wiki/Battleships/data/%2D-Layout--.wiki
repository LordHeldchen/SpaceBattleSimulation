++ OBSOLETE Layout

Layouts define a ship. The type of ship that is to be defined tells only which layouts are available. It says nothing about the ship itself; without any layouts, its not even an empty hull.
Layouts are:

- [Hull OBSOLETE Layout]
- [Weapon OBSOLETE Layout]
- [Shield OBSOLETE Layout]
- [Propulsion OBSOLETE Layout]
- [Electronics OBSOLETE Layout]
