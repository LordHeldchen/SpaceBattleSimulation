++ Ship Types

+ Defining Ships

All ships are divided up into so-called [Sections] (maybe except for Fighters and Drones). Those sections have a basic concept of being adjacent to one another so that damage distribution works well. [Sections] may only be the target of an external attack if other [Protective Measures] have failed.

Alltogether those sections define the [Stats] of a Ship.
