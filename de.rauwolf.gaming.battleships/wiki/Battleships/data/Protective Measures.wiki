++ Protective Measures

Armor provides additional Armor-Hitpoints per Section it is attached to, plus it provides absolute damage reduction as long as Armor-Hitpoints remain. This reduction is reduced by destroyed attached sections probably may (partially) be bypassed by critical hits.

Armor normally adds weigth, thereby lowering the overall agility of the ship. It depends on the size of the section that is to be protected how much Armor-Hitpoints it gets and how large the penalties are.
