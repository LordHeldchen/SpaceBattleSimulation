++ Science Tree

+++ Development
Standard Science cost, but probably some techs (breakthroughs likely) cannot be researched without a major building project that is to be done beforehand? Analyze impact on pace and balancing!


+++ Types of Technologies

* Fundamental Research (solely requirement for new development)
  * Breakthrough (high cost, unlocks completely new type of technology, e.g. Laser Beams)
  * Logical advancement (the next step in an existing type of technology, e.g. High Frequency Lasers)
* Application (unlocks new parts)
* Refinement (improves existing parts)
