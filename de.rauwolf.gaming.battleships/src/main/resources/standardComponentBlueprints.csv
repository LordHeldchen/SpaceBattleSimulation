# "modifer" can be a a flat bonus (denoted as "\d+" or a factor (denoted as "\d+(.\d+)?%").
# Flat bonuses are applied before factors. Modifiers of the same type are added before they are applied.
# Possible modifed stats are:
### acc   --> Accuracy
### ini   --> Bonus initiative at battle start. Base initiative is rolled as (baseStartInitiative of hull + rand(200)).
### glan  --> Armor Glance Threshold: Armor Penetration of a weapon + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to cause a glancing hit.
### hit   --> Armor Hit Threshold:    Armor Penetration of a weapon + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to cause a normal hit.
### crit  --> Armor Crit Threshold:   Armor Penetration of a weapon + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to cause a critical hit. Crits may cause a ship to explode instantly.
### cont  --> Containment: Lowers Chance of instant explosion on a critical hit. Formula is
###                        (criticalDamageAfterShields - containment) / currentHullStrength
###                        If currentHullStrength reaches zero the ship still is destroyed, even if containment would prevent an explosion.
### man   --> Maneuverability: acc + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to hit. Minimum chance to hit always is 5%, accuracy of a specific shot is buffed accordingly if necessary.
### shp   --> Shield hit points
### sreg  --> Shield regeneration in tenths per tick. Only in effect if shield is not broken or shield regeneration is delayed for some reason (e.g. initiative of ship is not high enough).
### sbrk  --> Duration in ticks shields are knocked out when broken. Calculated result is divided by amount of flat sbrk-values,
###           i.e. 2 shields with 10 and 20 knockout duration respectively will result in an overall knockout duration of 15.
###           Factors are handled differently: An additional component reducing above duration by 50%, i.e. a component that applies a factor of -50%, will result in the otherwise same configuration having a knockout duration of 8.
### epm   --> Chance to avoid adverse non-damaging effects, e.g. tickloss or jamming. Formula for the chance to avoid an adverse effect with strength "strength" is
###           strength / (epm + strength)
### r-xxx --> Resistance against specific damage types (lowers AP of weapon before rolling for hit type). Available resistance keys are:
###           HEAT: heat, EM: em, KINETIC: kin, EXPLOSIVE: exp, ANTIMATTER: anti, PARTICLE: part
#
# Shield mechanics:
# Shields deflect damage _before_ the hit type is determined (i.e. deflected, glancing hit, normal hit or a critical blow).
# Therefore shields always take damage if the ship is hit, but they do regenerate quite fast and prevent any critical damage (and therefore explosions) as long as they are up.
# Even if they finally break, damage is lowered by their remaining strength, again before the hit type is determined and corresponding multipliers are applied.
#
# Shield hitpoints (shp), shield regeneration (sreg), EPM and value do scale with the hull size the component is installed in. Factors per hull size class are:
#  XXS:  1
#   XS:  2
#    S:  4
#    M:  9
#    L: 16
#   XL: 30
#  XXL: 100
