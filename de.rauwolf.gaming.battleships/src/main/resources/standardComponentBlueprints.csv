# "modifer" can be a a flat bonus (denoted as "\d+" or a factor (denoted as "\d+(.\d+)?%").
# Flat bonuses are applied before factors. Modifiers of the same type (stat and value) are added before they are applied.
# Possible modifed stats are:
### acc   --> Accuracy
### ini   --> Bonus initiative at battle start. Base initiative is rolled as (baseStartInitiative of hull + rand(200)).
### glan  --> Armor Glance Threshold: Armor Penetration of a weapon + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to cause a glancing hit.
### hit   --> Armor Hit Threshold:    Armor Penetration of a weapon + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to cause a normal hit.
### crit  --> Armor Crit Threshold:   Armor Penetration of a weapon + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to cause a critical hit. Crits may cause a ship to explode instantly.
### cont  --> Containment: Lowers Chance of instant explosion on a critical hit. Formula is
###                        (criticalDamageAfterShields - containment) / currentHullStrength
###                        If currentHullStrength reaches zero the ship still is destroyed, even if containment would prevent an explosion.
### eva   --> Evasion: acc + rand(100) needs to be greater than this in order to hit. Minimum chance to hit always is 5%, accuracy of a specific shot is buffed accordingly if necessary.
### shp   --> Shield hit points
### sreg  --> Shield regeneration in tenths per tick. Only in effect if shield is not broken or shield regeneration is delayed for some reason (e.g. initiative of ship is not high enough).
### sbrk  --> Duration in ticks shields are knocked out when broken. Calculated result is divided by amount of flat sbrk-values,
###           i.e. 2 shields with 10 and 20 knockout duration respectively will result in an overall knockout duration of 15.
###           Factors are handled differently: An additional component reducing above duration by 50%, i.e. a component that applies a factor of -50%, will result in the otherwise same configuration having a knockout duration of 8.
### epm   --> Chance to avoid adverse non-damaging effects, e.g. tickloss or jamming. Formula for the chance to avoid an adverse effect with strength "strength" is
###           strength / (epm + strength)
#
# On Shield mechanics:
# Shields deflect damage _before_ a hit is determined to be a glancing or a critical blow.
# Therefore shields always take damage if the ship is hit, but they do regenerate quite fast and prevent any critical damage as long as they are up.
# Even if they finally break, damage is lowered by their remaining strength, again before the remaining damage of a hit is determined to be critical or not and multiplied accordingly.
#
# Shield hitpoints (shp), shield regeneration (sreg) and EPM do scale with the hull size the component is installed in, as does the value for all components. Factors per hull size class are:
#   XS:  1
#    S:  4
#    M:  9
#    L: 16
#   XL: 25
#  XXL: 40
