fighter;     Fighter;            100; 120;   100;  5;  30;  60;   1 0 0 0 0 0 0;    1 0 0 0;   All-time useful basic fighter hull. Quite hard to hit and therefore pretty pesky, especially against ships with mainly big weapons.
hfighter;    Heavy Fighter;       90; 110;   140; 10;  30;  65;   2 0 0 0 0 0 0;    1 0 0 0;   Heavier version of the fighter. Provides two times the firepower for about one and a half times the cost. Not as viable for direct combat as the standard fighter though, since its armor has only been upgraded marginally.
bomber;      Bomber;              85; 100;   200; 15;  40;  70;   0 1 0 0 0 0 0;    2 0 0 0;   Bombers are meant to be fitted as anti capital ships. While able to carry potent bombs close to target while withering countless point defense barrages, the only other role bombers are suitable for are as eWar platforms.
frigate;     Frigate;             75; 100;   350; 20;  50;  80;   0 0 2 0 0 0 0;    1 0 1 0;   Frigates are the ship of choice when the mission is about harrassing enemy ships or taking apart small fleets fast. Considerable firepower, solid armor (versus fighters at least) and high speed makes Frigates the ideal raiding and escort ships.
destroyer;   Destroyer;           70;  80;   500; 30;  65; 100;   0 0 4 0 0 0 0;    0 1 1 0;   Destroyers are ships dedicated to spread out firepower with average stats in every respect, which is the reason why they are mainly used for escort duty.
lcruiser;    Light Cruiser;       60;  65;   900; 40;  75; 110;   0 0 2 2 0 0 0;    1 0 1 1;   As the smallest fully flegded fleet ship, light cruisers are able to hold their own in small fleet actions. In larger engagements, they fill a valuable niche as versatile support vessels, capable of filling many roles depending on loadout.
bcruiser;    Battle Cruiser;      45;  50;  1600; 55;  90; 125;   0 0 4 3 0 0 0;    2 0 0 1;   Built for extensive incursions into enemy territory, the Battlecruiser unifies firepower and versatility like no other ship. Though probably not the best choice for direct combat in large engagements, it IS the best choice for almost all other scenarios.
acruiser;    Artillery Cruiser;   50;  50;  1000; 35;  70; 100;   0 0 0 0 0 1 0;    0 1 1 0;   'Offense is the best defense' was clearly on the minds of the designers of this variant of the light cruiser. Featuring a single superheavy weapon mount and not much else, this 'cruiser' is nothing but a dedicated fire support platform.  
bship;       Battleship;          30;  30;  2500; 70; 115; 150;   0 0 0 4 2 0 0;    1 2 2 0;   Battleships are the mainstay of any Fleet in this universe, whatever form they take. Their extreme durability and heavy weapon mounts makes them the perfect warmachines.
dnought;     Dreadnought;         15;  10;  4000; 75; 130; 160;   0 0 0 0 4 1 0;    0 2 2 0;   Dreadnoughts were the first design to shape the supercapital era of space warfare. Because everything on a Dreadnought is oversized, Fighters and small craft were reinvented and improved as an effective counter. But it needs swarms of fighters to take down even a single one of these behemoths.
