- Schilde mithilfe von payload sofort wieder aufladen, wenn leer und Runde des tragenden Schiffes
- Defensiver Timewarp: Chance, Schaden komplett zu vermeiden (unabhängig von Rüstung und evade)
- Offensiver Timewarp: Chance, keine Geschwindigkeit nach Feuern zu verbrauchen
- Höhere Reichweite (i.e. höhere Start-battlespeed) bei geringerer Zielgenauigkeit (insbesondere f. Standard-Fighter, Kreuzer, Schlachtschiffe)
- Unterscheidung nach "reflective shield" und "multiphasic shield" (siehe GSB)
- Schilde für Fighter  
- Regenerierende Panzerung
- Types of Weapons:
  * Railguns, which simply pierce "non-hardened" Barrier Shields
- Add "tactics" attribute in fleets, so that the same target might be attacked more often.
  Probably create collection of already hit targets which is chosen at a certain percentage
  instead of some random target (which may be the same target again)
- Make initial battle speed dependent on weapon range
- Interceptors should NOT have the overall highest initial battle speed (even though it may be quite high), simply because of their short range
  and missing cloaking. They SHOULD however be the unit qith the slowest battlespeed-decay and the best elusiveness.
- Load the available layouts and modifications from a config file. Modifications are per definition available for Layouts.

ArmorModifications:
- Heavy: Obviously.
- Ablative: Strong defense, but only once. Little or even no handicap in speed.
- Regenerating: Obviously.

HullLayouts: Dub as armor and as cargo layout. Do NOT dub as subtype for specific ship classes (they still are e.g. "interceptor" and "bomber" for fighters).
- Mechanic hull
- Organic hull
